    "introduction": "Aristophanes’ \"Clouds\" is a bold and satirical comedy that offers a sharp critique of Athenian intellectual trends in the late 5th century BCE, particularly the rise of sophistry and the figure of Socrates. Set in a fictionalized Athens, the play follows Strepsiades, an aging debtor, who enrolls his son in the “Thinkery,” a school led by a caricatured Socrates, in hopes of learning rhetorical tricks to evade his creditors. With biting humor and inventive imagery—including the titular chorus of Clouds as personifications of lofty thinking—Aristophanes mocks the perceived moral decay brought on by new philosophies. “Clouds” is both a theatrical masterpiece and a cultural artifact, reflecting the tensions between tradition and intellectual innovation in classical Athens. It remains a vivid window into the public perception of philosophy and education in the ancient world.",
